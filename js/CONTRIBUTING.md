# Contributing to Gradio

![GitHub issues by-label](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/gradio-app/gradio/good%20first%20issue?color=fe7c01&link=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fgradio-app%2Fgradio%2Fissues%3Fq%3Dis%253Aopen%2Bis%253Aissue%2Blabel%253A%2522good%2Bfirst%2Bissue%2522)


More than 200 awesome developers have contributed to the `gradio` library, and we'd be thrilled if you would like to be the next contributor! 

Prerequisites:

- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Node.js v16.14+](https://nodejs.dev/en/download/package-manager/) (only needed if you are making changes to the frontend)
- [pnpm 8.1+](https://pnpm.io/8.x/installation) (only needed if you are making changes to the frontend)
 
## üè° Setup for local development

There are a few ways to install and run Gradio.

### üõ†Ô∏è Install Gradio locally from `main`

- Clone this repo
- Navigate to the repo directory and (from the root directory) run

```bash
bash scripts/install_gradio.sh
```

- Build the front end

```
bash scripts/build_frontend.sh
```

-  Install development requirements

(Note that it is highly recommended to use a virtual environment running **Python 3.9** since the versions of Gradio's dependencies are pinned)

```
bash scripts/install_test_requirements.sh
```

If you have a different Python version and conflicting packages during the installation, please first run:

```
bash scripts/create_test_requirements.sh
```

### üì¶ Using dev containers

You can alternatively use dev containers. This is supported on all platforms (macOS/Windows/Linux), as well as on GitHub Codespaces. 

Prerequisites:

- An editor which supports dev containers, like VS Code
- Docker support on the host computer:
  - macOS: [Docker Desktop 2.0+](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
  - Windows: [Docker Desktop 2.0+](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
  - Linux: [Docker CE/EE 18.06+](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose 1.21+](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- If using VS Code, the [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension

Steps:

- Clone repository
- Open it in your editor
- For VS Code, execute `Dev Containers: Reopen in container` command

For detailed instructions, please see the [Dev Containers tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial).

## üß± Structure of the Repository

If you're a newcomer to Gradio, we recommend getting familiar with the overall structure of the repository so that you can focus on the part of the source code you'd like to contribute to.

- `/gradio`: contains the Python source code for the library
  - `/gradio/interface.py`: contains the Python source code for the core `Interface` class
  - `/gradio/blocks.py`: contains the Python source code for the core `Blocks` class
  - `/gradio/components/`: the directory that contains the Python source code for all of the Gradio components.
- `/js`: contains the HTML/JS/CSS source code for the library ([start here for frontend changes](/js/README.md))
  - `/js/_website`: contains the code for the Gradio website (www.gradio.app). See the README in the `/js/_website` folder for more details
- `/test`: contains Python unit tests for the library
- `/demo`: contains demos that are used in the documentation, you can find `Gradio` examples over here.


## üöÄ Run a Gradio app

You can get started by creating an `app.py` file in the root:

```
import gradio as gr

with gr.Blocks() as demo:
   gr.Button()
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
   demo.launch()
```

then run:

```
gradio app.py
```

This will start the backend server in reload mode, which will watch for changes in the `gradio` folder and reload the app if changes are made. By default, Gradio will launch on port 7860. You can also just use `python app.py`, but this won't automatically trigger updates. 


If you're making frontend changes, start the frontend server:

```
pnpm dev
```

This will open a separate browser tab. By default, Gradio will launch this on port 9876. Any changes to the frontend will also reload automatically in the browser. For more information about developing in the frontend, you can refer to [js/README.md](js/README.md).

We also have demos of all our components in the `/gradio/demo` directory. To get our simple gradio Chatbot running locally:

```
gradio demo/chatbot_simple/run.py
```


## üß™ Testing

We use Pytest, Playwright and Vitest to test our code. 

- The Python tests are located in `/test`. To run these tests:

```
bash scripts/run_all_tests.sh
```

- The frontend unit tests are any defined with the filename `*.test.ts`. To run them:

```
pnpm test
```

- Browser tests are located in `js/app/test` and are defined as `*spec.ts` files. To run browser tests:

```
pnpm test:browser
```

To build the frontend code before running browser tests:

```
pnpm test:browser:full
```

You can also run browser tests in the UI mode by adding the `--ui` flag: 

```
pnpm test:browser --ui
```

If you have made any significant visual changes to a component, we encourage you to add a new Storybook story or amend an existing one to reflect them. You can create a new story with a `*.stories.svelte` file. You can run the storybook locally:

```
pnpm storybook
```

## üï∏Ô∏è Gradio Website

We also welcome any contributions to our [website](https://www.gradio.app). 

First, build the website:

```
pnpm build:cdn-local
```
then serve the website build:
```
pnpm preview:cdn-local
```

This will serve a build of `gradio.js` on port `4321`. You can then navigate to `js/_website/src/routes/+layout.svelte` and replace the source of the website build from:
```
<script type="module" src="https://gradio.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/{version}/gradio.js"></script>
```
to 
```
<script type="module" src="http://localhost:4321/gradio.js"></script>
```

You should now be able to view a local version of the website at `http://localhost:4321`. 

## üåé Gradio-Lite

Gradio-Lite is a Pyodide-based library that lets you run Gradio serverless (in other words, directly in your browser).

You can start the development server by running:
```
bash scripts/run_lite.sh
```

If you make changes to the Python code during development, you will need to rebuild the Python packages loaded to Graio-Lite. To do this, run:
```
pnpm --filter @gradio/app pybuild
```

To generate the release build, run:
```
bash scripts/build_lite.sh
```
The release build will be located in the `dist` directory in the `js/lite` project.
To test it, you can run a local server in the `js/lite` directory:
```
python -m http.server --directory js/lite
```
and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser. The demo page `index.html` located in the `js/lite` directory will be loaded.

## üìÆ Submitting PRs

All PRs should be against `main`, and ideally should address an open issue, unless the change is small. Direct commits to main are blocked, and PRs require an approving review to merge into main. By convention, the Gradio maintainers will review PRs when:

- An initial review has been requested
- A clear, descriptive title has been assigned to the PR
- A maintainer (@abidlabs, @aliabid94, @aliabd, @AK391, @dawoodkhan82, @pngwn, @freddyaboulton, @hannahblair, @hysts, @whitphx) is tagged in the PR comments and asked to complete a review

 üßπ We ask that you make sure initial CI checks are passing before requesting a review. One of the Gradio maintainers will merge the PR when all the checks are passing.  You can safely ignore the Vercel and Spaces checks, which only run under maintainers' pull requests.  

Don't forget the format your code before pushing:

```
bash scripts/format_backend.sh
```

And if you made changes to the frontend: 

```
bash scripts/format_frontend.sh
```

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to Gradio!

## üöß Troubleshooting
`ERROR: Error loading ASGI app. Could not import module "<filename>"`

Verify that you've used the correct filename of your gradio app, and that you're in the directory of the file. 

---

```ERR_PNPM_RECURSIVE_RUN_FIRST_FAIL @gradio/app@1.0.0 build:local: vite build --mode production:local --emptyOutDir "--emptyOutDir"```

Delete `/node_modules` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`:

```
rm -rf node_modules/
rm pnpm-lock.yaml
```

and run the install scripts:

```
bash scripts/install_gradio.sh
bash scripts/build_frontend.sh
```
